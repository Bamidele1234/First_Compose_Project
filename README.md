# First Compose Project
The very first time I am working with Jetpack Compose

# What I learnt
* Defining composable functions
* Adding different elements in the composable
* Structuring my UI component using layout composables
* Extending composables using modifiers
* Creating an efficient list
* Keeping track of state and modifying it
* Adding user interaction(with click listeners) on a composable
* Animating messages while expanding them

# Personal thoughts
Jetpack compose is way better than using XML and it makes UI development more efficient.
I also like the ability to enable the interactive mode without deploying it on an emulator or on an Android device
